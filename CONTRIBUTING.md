Thank you for your interest in contributing to FitForm AI! üéâ

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RepRight.git
cd RepRight
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Copy the config template
cp Config.swift.example FitFormAI/FitFormAI/Config.swift

# Add your OpenAI API key to FitFormAI/FitFormAI/Config.swift
# See SECURITY.md for details
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## üîê Security Rules

**NEVER commit these files:**
- `FitFormAI/FitFormAI/Config.swift` (contains your API key)
- `.env` files with real keys
- Any file with actual API keys or secrets

**Always:**
- Use `Config.swift.example` as a template
- Keep your API keys in gitignored files
- Review your changes before committing: `git diff`

## Code Style

### Swift Code
- Use SwiftLint recommendations
- Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### File Organization
```

## Development Tips

### Testing AI Features

To avoid excessive API costs during development:

1. **Use mock responses** for initial testing
2. **Cache API responses** during development
3. **Use shorter videos** for form analysis testing
4. **Set OpenAI spending limits** on your account

### Debugging

- Use Xcode's debugger: Set breakpoints with `‚åò + \`
- Print statements: `print("Debug: \(variable)")`
- View console: `‚áß + ‚åò + C`

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Check that `Config.swift` exists in `FitFormAI/FitFormAI/`
- Verify your API key is set correctly

**Build errors**
- Clean build folder: `‚áß + ‚åò + K`
- Rebuild: `‚åò + B`
