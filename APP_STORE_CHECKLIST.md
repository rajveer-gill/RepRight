## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Submission)

### 1. OpenAI API Key Architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR ISSUE**
**Problem:** Your API key is hardcoded in the client app (`Config.swift`).
- **Each user would need their own API key** (not user-friendly)
- **You can't monetize** or control usage
- **Security risk** if key is exposed

**Solutions:**
**Option A (Recommended):** Build a backend service
- Create a simple Node.js/Python backend
- Store your API key on the server
- App makes requests to your backend ‚Üí backend calls OpenAI
- You control costs, can add subscriptions, rate limiting

**Option B:** Make it free with usage limits
- Users enter their own API key in-app
- Add warning that it requires a paid OpenAI account
- Not ideal for App Store

### 2. Privacy Policy Required üîê
**Required for:** Camera, Photo Library, Microphone permissions

Create a privacy policy covering:
- What data you collect (workout videos, user profiles)
- How you use it (local storage only, OpenAI API)
- Third-party services (OpenAI's policies)
- Host it online and add URL to App Store Connect

### 3. Debug Code Removal üßπ
Remove all debug print statements:
- 7 prints in `AppState.swift` ‚úÖ (Done)
